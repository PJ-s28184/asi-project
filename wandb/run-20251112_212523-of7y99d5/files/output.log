Presets specified: ['best_quality']
Using hyperparameters preset: hyperparameters='zeroshot'
Setting dynamic_stacking from 'auto' to True. Reason: Enable dynamic_stacking when use_bag_holdout is disabled. (use_bag_holdout=False)
Stack configuration (auto_stack=True): num_stack_levels=1, num_bag_folds=8, num_bag_sets=1
DyStack is enabled (dynamic_stacking=True). AutoGluon will try to determine whether the input data is affected by stacked overfitting and enable or disable stacking as a consequence.
	This is used to identify the optimal `num_stack_levels` value. Copies of AutoGluon will be fit on subsets of the data. Then holdout validation data is used to detect stacked overfitting.
	Running DyStack for up to 150s of the 600s of remaining time (25%).
